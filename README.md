## ✨ Features  

### 🧮 Basic Mode  
✅ Performs **four classic operations**:  
- ➕ Addition (`+`)  
- ➖ Subtraction (`-`)  
- ✖ Multiplication (`x`)  
- ➗ Division (`/`)  

A simple calculator just like what we use in daily life!  

### 🔬 Scientific Mode  
✅ Includes **advanced mathematical functions**:  
- 📏 Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)  
- 🔢 Exponentiation (`^`)  
- 📈 Logarithm (`log`, `ln`)  
- 📊 Natural logarithm (`ln`) and Euler’s number (`e`)  

> 💡 *Currently working on a feature to allow custom inputs for exponentiation and logarithms!*
